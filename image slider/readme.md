💡✨ My Creative Image Slider Project! 🚀
I'm super excited to share my latest project — a Responsive & Interactive Image Slider built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 
🎨🧠

🔥 What makes it special?
✅ Smooth transition effects
✅ Stylish dot indicators & navigation buttons
✅ Fully responsive on all devices
✅ Clean UI with modern aesthetics
✅ Easily customizable for portfolios or product galleries

This project challenged me to combine logic with creativity — and it turned out to be such a fun and rewarding learning experience! 💪💻

🌈 How it works:
1. All images are placed inside a horizontal scrollable container.
2. JavaScript updates the slider’s position using translateX() based on the current image index.
3. Navigation buttons (⬅️ ➡️) allow users to move between images.
4. Dots below the slider highlight the current image dynamically.
5. Responsive layout adjusts beautifully on both desktop and mobile!

🔍 Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
