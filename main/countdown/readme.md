🚀 Just launched a fun little project – an Animated Countdown! ⏳

I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean design and smooth animations. With just a click, the countdown kicks off from 10 to 0 — perfect for intros, splash screens, or just having fun with web effects!

✨ Features:

✅ Cool glowing animation for each number 💥

✅ Smooth transitions and minimal UI

✅ Fully responsive & mobile-friendly

✅ Great for presentations, product reveals, or just learning DOM & animation!

=> This was a fun way to practice DOM manipulation, styling with gradients and shadows, 
and adding animations using @keyframes.
