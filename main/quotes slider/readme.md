🎉 Just  a new mini-project: “Quotes Slider” — a clean, animated web component that displays inspirational quotes with smooth transitions.

This was a fun way to practice DOM manipulation, animations, and responsive design — while adding a touch of motivation to the screen. 💡

💻 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🔍 Features:

✅ Beautiful quote transition effects using CSS animations

✅ Auto-slide & manual navigation (optional)

✅ Responsive layout for mobile & desktop

✅ Clean, modern UI with motivational vibe ✨

🧠 Through this project, I practiced:

1. DOM manipulation using JavaScript

2. Creating smooth animations & transitions

3. Responsive and accessible design
